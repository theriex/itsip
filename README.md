# itsip
iTunes&reg; Situational Playlist Generator

Purpose
=======

Automatic creation of playlists for common "just need some music"
situations, using tracks from your own library and based on your own
categorizations.  Itsip is not intended as a substitute for hand
curated playlists such as you might use for romantic situations,
having new friends over for dinner the first time etc.  What itsip
provides is a way to get back into your collection without having to
scroll through a massive track list or put up with automatic
suggestions that don't have enough variety.

Using itsip:
-----------

After installing, categorize and rate all your tracks.  That will take
a while, but if you want to pull tracks based on your impressions then
you need to record what your impressions are.  The only shortcut here
is that if you trust someone else's tastes, and they will send you an
import file, then you can load their impressions into your library.
Even with that, you need to get used to the idea of classifying tracks
while you are listening.  This may make you less productive at
whatever else you are doing, but it's probably about time you did one
pass through your whole collection anyway.

After tracks are categorized, you can generate a new playlist for any
situation simply by selecting what keywords should be included and
what should not.  You can export playlists and associated tracks to a
separate folder, and you can export your ratings and categorizations
to a flat file to move to another computer.
